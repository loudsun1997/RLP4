Here are the list of commands that I ran. I got errors following the documentation I sent in the group chat. 

pip install gym
conda install swig
pip install box2d
pip install gym[box2d] -> I believe this did not work so I ran the lines that came after it
pip install gym[atari] 
pip install box2d pygame
pip install --upgrade gym ale-py -> ran this after getting errors when trying to run code
pip install gym[atari,accept-rom-license] -> ran this after getting errors when trying to run code
pip install -U nptyping -> ran this after getting errors when trying to run code
